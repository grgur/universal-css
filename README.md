# Universal CSS Loader for Universal (Isomorphic) React Apps

Inline styles used to be the way to show just the style needed for your server-side rendered React page (route). However, inline styles are difficult to reuse, debug, and can add quite a bit of bloat to your page and JS bundle. 

*Universal CSS Loader* let's you use CSS (SCSS and Less work as well) to embed just the styles used for the view to render. 

Since you're working with plain old CSS, you can still use [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/), [PreCSS](https://github.com/jonathantneal/precss), [CSS Nano](http://cssnano.co/), [PurifyCSS](purifycss), [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), and the likes.
